# Phase 6 continuation prompt

Phase 6 is the build. Read this file at the start of any session that continues build work. It is written to be sufficient on its own: reading it is the whole handoff, and no other instruction is needed to begin.

## Start here

If you were handed this file and nothing else, this section is the instruction. Work it top to bottom, then stop reading and act.

### Step 1: know which session you are in

Run this first. It is one command and it decides what you are allowed to do:

```bash
echo "${ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL:-primary provider}"
```

- Prints `primary provider`: you are on the subscription. Every stage is available to you. Go to step 2.
- Prints a URL: you are on the alternate metered backend, and only some stages are yours to run. Read "Which session to open, before anything else" below for which, then come back. If the next action is one you may not run, stop and say so rather than running it anyway.

Do not skip this. The constraint is not recoverable once a session is running, and the failure is silent: a judge dispatched on the alternate backend runs on the builder's model and nothing reports the substitution.

### Step 2: do the next action

The next action is always one line, kept current at the top of "State now" below. Right now it is:

> Build phase 3.1 is DONE. Its outstanding re-review debt closed via PR #23 (commit `97aec83`) on 2026-08-07, after three independent re-review rounds, the last one by a reviewer dispatched specifically to avoid trusting a same-session self-check. Next: the F-2.1-C15 generation bound on `fix/c15-generation-bound`, then open 3.2.

Full detail on what PR #23 fixed, the two things deliberately left as open product decisions rather than fixed unilaterally (F-3.1-41, F-3.1-42), and three new minor follow-ups filed by the final reviewer (F-3.1-50, F-3.1-51, plus one already-tracked as F-3.1-46), is `tracker/phase_3.1.md`'s Findings table, current as of 2026-08-07.

### Step 3: how a phase runs across sessions

`/bossman` runs stages 1 to 11 and stops only at the phase boundary. The provider split cuts across those stages and cannot change inside a running session. Those two facts collide, so a budget-split phase is three sessions, not one:

| Session | Launch | Stages | Tell it |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| 1 | `claude` | 1 to 5 | "open the phase, stop once the premise gate is written and failing" |
| 2 | `claude-build` | 6 to 7 | "work the tickets, stop at the judge" |
| 3 | `claude` | 8 to 11 | "judge, adversary, gates, open the pull request" |

Bossman does not stop at stage boundaries on its own, so each session needs its stop condition stated in the prompt.

The simpler default, and the right one while subscription budget is healthy: run the whole phase in one session on `claude`. The three-session split exists to rescue a week that would otherwise be lost, not as a daily routine. Reach for it when the limit is close, not before. In one line: use `claude` until it stops working, then use `claude-build`.

## State now

NEXT ACTION, the single line "Start here" step 2 refers to. Keep it current: whoever finishes a stage updates this line before ending the session, because it is what the next session reads first.

> Build phase 3.1 is DONE. Merged as PR #23 (commit `97aec83`) on 2026-08-07. Next: the F-2.1-C15 generation bound on `fix/c15-generation-bound`, then open 3.2.

Build phase 3.1 merged as PR #22 on 2026-08-05 without the adversarial pass over its own fix round, which was the stated pre-merge condition. That gap closed across three re-review rounds, all 2026-08-07: a first re-review found the merged commit FAIL (11 of 26 findings closed clean, 15 reopened, 9 new defects including two critical), a fix round closed nearly all of it, a second re-review of THAT fix round found one more critical soundness gap (alias-matching in gene resolution could silently return a confidently WRONG gene, not just fail to resolve) plus a scattering of smaller issues, and a FOURTH reviewer, dispatched specifically because every fix so far had only been checked in the same session that wrote it, independently re-verified the whole branch fresh against live NCBI and returned APPROVE. Merged as PR #23. Full account: `tracker/phase_3.1.md`'s Findings table, including the "Final independent review" section at the bottom.

Two things were deliberately left open rather than fixed, both genuine product decisions, not bugs: whether the stopword list should exclude entries that are themselves real gene symbols (F-3.1-41), and what happens when a gene is mentioned in lowercase (F-3.1-42). Three more minor, non-blocking findings from the final review are carried to before `ncbi_efetch` gets wired into `act_node` (F-3.1-50, F-3.1-51, and F-3.1-46 already tracked).

Eight build phases are done and merged into `main`. The first six complete the Step 6.1 prototype group; 3.0 and 3.1 are the first two Step 6.3 v1 phases:

| Phase | Delivered | PR |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| 1.0 | FastAPI skeleton, the typed event contract, Pydantic boundary validation | #5 |
| 1.1 | Auth service, the PostgreSQL user-data schema | #6 |
| 2.0 | Real LangGraph agent loop, the three-tier harness | #9 |
| 1.2 | React shell, SSE streaming, chat UI wired end to end | #12 |
| 2.1 | cypher_query over Layer 1, first live graph access | #15 |
| 2.2 | Deterministic cite-or-refuse, Layer 1 provenance, the first trust signal | #18 |
| 3.0 | The full Section 10 guardrail, replacing the passthrough stub | #19 |
| 3.1 | ncbi_efetch, the first Layer 2 tool: seven actions across three API families, live gene-symbol resolution replacing the one-entry hardcoded table | Merged as PR #22 on 2026-08-05, PR #23 on 2026-08-07 |

Current counts, stated once here:

- Python tests: 1798
- Frontend tests: 120
- Playwright end-to-end tests: 3
- Premise gate, cypher_query: 9 of 9
- Premise gate, write-step grounding: 11 passed, 1 xfailed by design
- Premise gate, guardrail: 20 of 20
- Premise gate, ncbi_efetch: 19 passed, 1 skipped (tunnel)
- Decisions logged: 225
- Learnings entries: 53, plus a retrospective

Next in the build order is build phase 3.2, `ncbi_dbsnp`, the second Layer 2 tool, but one thing comes before it and is dated: F-2.1-C15 on `fix/c15-generation-bound`, which `tracker/BOARD.md` dates to immediately after 3.1 merges and which is the finding where a generated query took the graph server down for every user.

The build phase 3.1 tool surface is complete and its findings are settled: 40 of 42 numbered findings closed, F-3.1-04 carried to T-3.1-28 (the answer-path half: Act-step wiring, Layer 2 citation, trust gate), and exactly two left open on genuine product decisions, F-3.1-41 and F-3.1-42, detailed in `tracker/phase_3.1.md`.

Step 6.2 moved on 2026-08-03. It now runs AFTER the 3.x tool phases rather than between 2.2 and 3.0, because its own written reasoning names 3.x as the code its security scan most exists for, and because reconciling the frozen documents after the tool phases is better input than reconciling before them. Its security scan is separately PAUSED INDEFINITELY on cost, with one condition that turns it back on: exposure. First contact with a real user, a deploy, or a public URL triggers it, whichever comes first.

Per-phase detail lives in `tracker/phase_N.M.md`. Phase narrative lives in `requirements/Plan.md`'s Revision history. Phase status and the flags that gate a phase live in `tracker/BOARD.md`.

One exception to the one-owner convention, stated rather than left to be discovered. The Open items table below is NOT a copy of `tracker/BOARD.md`. Measured 2026-08-04: of its 28 tracked identifiers, 14 also appear on the board and 14 appear nowhere else in the repository. So the table is the full forward backlog by owner and is the sole record for half its rows, while the board carries the subset that blocks a specific phase from closing. Where an item appears in both, the board's "Resolve before" column is authoritative.

That split is a known wart rather than a design: the board is the incomplete one. Folding the 14 orphans into it would break the renderer's invariant that every phase's flag count matches the Open flags table, so it is a deliberate task and not a tidy-up. Until then, do not delete a row here on the assumption the board already has it.

## Which session to open, before anything else

Added 2026-08-04. The build harness has an alternate, metered model backend for when the primary provider's weekly budget runs out. It is scoped by ROLE, not by phase, and the choice is not recoverable after the fact, so make it before opening anything.

| Cadence stage | Launch with | Why |
|---------------|-------------|-----|
| 3, 5, 8, 9: decompose, premise gate, judge, adversary | `claude` | The only stages that genuinely need the primary provider. Everything spent elsewhere is taken from here |
| 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11: open, learnings, dispatch, build, log, gates, close | `claude-build` | Cheap and metered. Every token spent here is a token those four stages keep |
| 8, 9 when the primary budget is gone | `claude-review` | Records findings, closes nothing, and stages 8 and 9 re-run on `claude` before anything merges |

Three rules that are not negotiable, each with a reason:

- Never open a phase on the alternate backend. Stages 3 and 5 are where a bad split or a weak gate cascades into every builder dispatched afterwards.
- A review produced on the alternate backend is non-binding. It records findings and closes no ticket.
- Do not spend the primary provider on builder volume. The scarce resource is not money, it is capacity for the four stages that cannot run anywhere else. Burn it on building and you reach the limit with those four unfinished, which stalls the phase completely.

Why this needs a separate session rather than a per-dispatch model argument: on the alternate backend a session-wide subagent model overrides both the per-invocation model parameter and any subagent's own frontmatter, so a judge dispatched at Depth silently runs on the builder's model. Role tiering there is done by launching a different command, full stop.

The capability bands and the alternate-backend column are in `docs/build/Build_workflow_cadence.md` under "Provider mapping". The three commands above are local wrappers; the model identifiers, prices and credential location behind them are deliberately not in any tracked file and live in a local, uncommitted note under `docs/build/multi-model-harness/`. If the wrappers are not on this machine, that folder will not be either, and plain `claude` is unaffected.

## Read before opening the next phase

In this order:

1. `tracker/phase_3.2.md`. Create it by decomposing Section 6.3 of the technical specification. Read `tracker/phase_3.1.md` first for the transferable lessons: capture fixtures from live responses, never author them from a reading of the docs.
2. `requirements/Technical_specification.md` Section 6.3, the `ncbi_dbsnp` specification, plus Section 21.1 for the rate limits. Section 25 for the build order.
3. `docs/ncbi/Tool_implementation_mechanics.md`, the per-tool trap list. The load-bearing one for 3.2: `global_mafs` is an array, not a scalar, and the dbSNP clinical fetch runs sequentially after Variation Services normalization.
4. `LEARNINGS.md`, filtered to the tool-phase and model-generated-output entries. `docs/build/Build_workflow_cadence.md` stage 5's blocking premise gate applies to every tool phase from 3.2 to 3.5.
5. `docs/build/Build_velocity_post_mortem.md`, for the measured account of what the build process costs.

## Build phase 3.0, done

Merged as PR #19 on 2026-08-04, in one session, after one judge round and one adversary round.

What changed, stated against what was there before: `guardrail_node` previously made a throwaway Guard-tier call, discarded the response, and emitted a hardcoded `passed=True, category="ok"` for every query. It now runs Section 10.1's pipeline: the cheap non-LLM pre-filter (10.2), boundary validation closed to spec (10.3), Guard-tier classification of injection AND off-topic (10.4), and the forbidden-type and read-only screen (10.5).

Release gate outcome:

| Gate | Result |
|------|--------|
| Premise gate | 20 passed, 0 failed, re-run after every fix round |
| Python suite | 1261 passed, 62 skipped, 1 xfailed |
| `ruff check src/` | Clean |
| Guardrail unit tests | 148 across 6 files |
| Judge round 1 | FAIL, 2 confirmed defects, both fixed |
| Adversary round 1 | 8 findings, 4 acted on |
| Doc drift | 0 stale, 0 structural |

The premise gate has TWO ARMS, and that design decision is the phase's most transferable output. A guardrail has no safe direction of failure: `return refuse` scores one hundred percent on every attack test ever written and destroys the product. So nine of its eighteen cases are legitimate questions that must be ADMITTED, anchored on the v1 must-pass moat questions, including three collision traps where a real biomedical question shares a word with a block rule.

Three defects are worth carrying forward as patterns rather than as fixed bugs:

- The judge returned FAIL with all 34 acceptance criteria individually passing. `"What is the capital of the USA?"` was fully admitted, because the pre-filter's deliberately over-broad symbol pattern was excused by a code comment claiming the classifier would refuse it, and the classifier judged only injection. A deliberate weakness justified by "another layer covers it" is a claim about a DIFFERENT module and must be verified there. It is the F-2.1-J5-01 pattern, committed by an agent that had cited F-2.1-J5-01 by name an hour earlier.
- The adversary found four third-person clinical questions passing every layer. `"Should this patient be started on tamoxifen given her BRCA1 status?"` is not obfuscated. The pre-filter keyed on first person, the forbidden screen on literals, the classifier on injection, and nothing owned advice about a third party. A composition defect, invisible to 148 per-layer unit tests.
- The first allowlist refused the flagship question, because it carried `disease` and the question said `diseases`. Fixed by stemming the input rather than enumerating plurals, which is the allowlist-over-blocklist lesson already recorded on 2026-08-03.

Two tickets did not land and are carried, both on `tracker/BOARD.md` with dated positions: T-3.0-07 (clearing the F-2.1-J4-02 xfail needs the graph tunnel, which cannot be opened from this environment) and T-3.0-08 (F-2.1-C15's generation half, untouched, now dated to immediately after 3.1 merges).

## Build phase 3.1, done

Merged as PR #22 on 2026-08-05, then closed out fully via PR #23 on 2026-08-07 after its outstanding re-review debt was paid off. The answer-path half (Act-step wiring, Layer 2 citation, trust gate) is carried to T-3.1-28 by the product owner's decision.

What shipped: the `ncbi_efetch` tool, seven actions across three API families. E-utilities body-inspecting actions (search, summary, fetch, link), Datasets v2 gene/genome reports (status-coded), PubChem PUG REST property lookup (status-coded), and a five-step dbVar/ClinVar coordinate-overlap procedure with live-verified chromosome normalization. Live gene-symbol resolution via NCBI Datasets v2 and ESearch, replacing the one-entry hardcoded table.

PR #22 merged without the adversarial pass over its own fix round, the stated pre-merge condition, a recorded product-owner decision. PR #23 is that gap closed, across three re-review rounds run 2026-08-07:

| Round | Result |
|-------|--------|
| 1: six fresh-context reviewers, one per file cluster plus an adversary | FAIL. 11 of 26 findings closed clean, 15 reopened, 9 new defects including two critical (gene-symbol resolution completely broken; a field-tag fix using invalid Entrez syntax) |
| Fix round: six parallel builders in isolated worktrees | Closed nearly all of round 1's findings. Integrating their branches surfaced two cross-file seams no single builder could see alone |
| 2: three more fresh-context reviewers, live against NCBI | Found a genuine soundness gap neither round caught: NCBI's `[sym]` tag and the Datasets symbol endpoint both match on gene aliases, so an "unambiguous" match could silently return a confidently WRONG gene. Also a pre-existing bug that left one round-1 critical fix unreachable in production, a second URL-encoding gap, and a regression in round 2's own wait-budget fix. All fixed same-day |
| Final: one more fresh-context reviewer, dispatched specifically to avoid trusting same-session self-verification | APPROVE. Live re-confirmed both critical fixes and the alias-matching fix, re-ran the full gate suite independently, confirmed no test assertion was weakened, spot-checked 10 closed findings. Three new minor non-blocking findings filed. Merged as commit `97aec83` |

Final release gate: 1798 Python tests (1715 passed, 82 skipped, 1 xfailed), `ruff check src/ tests/` at the same 4 pre-existing errors this branch found and confirmed unrelated, doc drift clean, premise gate 19 passed / 1 skipped (tunnel-gated case 16). Full per-finding detail, all 42 numbered findings, and the final reviewer's evidence: `tracker/phase_3.1.md`.

Transferable lessons for the remaining tool phases:
- Capture fixtures from live responses, never author them from a reading of the docs. Two of round 1's criticals were hidden by fixtures hand-written from documentation, which tested the author's belief rather than the interface; the same pattern reappeared inside a FIX round's own new test fixtures during round 2.
- A tool that talks to a live external API needs an adversary who probes the actual API, not just a judge who reads the code. Every critical, in both the original phase and its fix round, came from the gap between what the API actually returns and what someone believed it returns.
- A same-session self-check is not an independent review, however thorough. Measured 3-for-3 this same day: the original merge, the six-builder fix round, and two of the lead's own individual patches each had a real defect only a fresh pass caught. Budget for the fresh pass, every time, not just once per phase.

## What build phase 3.2 delivers

From Section 25:

> `ncbi_dbsnp` (dbSNP REST API for rs identifiers, Variation Services for normalization, clinical significance)

Depends on 3.0 and 3.1. Read `docs/ncbi/Tool_implementation_mechanics.md` for the per-tool traps: `global_mafs` is an array, not a scalar, and the clinical fetch runs sequentially after Variation Services normalization.

## What Step 6.2 delivers, later

Runs after the 3.x tool phases, not next. From `requirements/Plan.md` Step 6.2, which is the authoritative list. Shape of it:

- Reconcile the PRD, technical specification and strategic memo against what the prototype taught. This is the one planned spec update before those three lock at v1.
- Reconcile the evaluation playbook, which is a living document rather than frozen.
- Sweep the accumulated new-intake folder, the one scheduled review point since Phase 4 locked.
- Carry build phase 2.1's premise-gate change into the tech spec, since Section 25 could not gain a ticket mid-build.
- Carry build phase 2.2's four grounding findings, including whether Section 8.2's matching rule survives contact with the spec as written.
- Decide whether Section 23's offline gate can be claimed at all before Layers 2 and 3 exist.
- Weigh the build-velocity post-mortem's recommendations.
- The whole-repository security scan is PAUSED INDEFINITELY on cost, and is no longer a prerequisite for Step 6.3. Exposure is the one thing that turns it back on.

## Open items

One decision below is still waiting on the product owner: whether `security/` stays gitignored. Still ignored today (`.gitignore:50`). This decides whether the Step 6.2 scan results are ever committed.

| Item | Description | Owner |
|------|-------------|-------|
| F-3.1-41: stopword list vs. real gene symbols | Product decision, not a bug. Detailed in `tracker/phase_3.1.md` | Whenever the product owner decides |
| F-3.1-42: lowercase gene mentions fall through silently | Product decision, not a bug. Detailed in `tracker/phase_3.1.md` | Whenever the product owner decides |
| F-3.1-50, F-3.1-51, F-3.1-46: minor gaps in code `act_node` cannot reach yet | Filed by the final independent review on PR #23. None live-exploitable until `ncbi_efetch` is wired into `act_node` | Before `ncbi_efetch` is wired into `act_node` (3.2 or later) |
| F-2.2-T-01-residual | A declarative injected as a comma-spliced clause inside a single wh-question still licenses its own words. Needs clause-level rather than sentence-level filtering. Pinned by a strict xfail | Step 6.2 |
| F-2.2-A-05 | The flagship gene-disease claim classifies `low` risk, since a `Disease` endpoint row is byte-identical to an identifier-lookup row at `risk_tier_for`'s boundary. Needs the traversed edge label plumbed through `Finding` and `SynthFinding`. Guarded against a naive widen | Step 6.2 |
| Section 8.2 matching rule | The substring branch answers whether a clause MENTIONS the cited value, never whether it is TRUE about it. The prototype closes this with two checks the spec does not describe | Step 6.2 |
| Section 23 offline gate | Its v1 must-pass questions need tools that arrive in build phases 3.1 to 3.5, so the full gate is not runnable yet | Step 6.2 |
| `release-workflow` dispatch gap | Marked mandatory in `bossman-mode.md`, 0 of 6 real dispatches. An ownerless requirement by this repo's own `attack-the-constraint` standard | Step 6.2 |
| Whole-repository security scan | No build-phase code has ever been scanned. One scan predates phase 1.0 | Step 6.2 |
| F-2.1-02 | Section 6.1 documents a parameter mechanism that cannot work; the same wrong claim also sits in `docs/ncbi/Tool_implementation_mechanics.md` and `.claude/rules/production-examples.md` | Step 6.2 |
| F-2.1-01 | The spec says 10 concept labels, the live graph has 11 (the eleventh is `NamedThing`) | Step 6.2 |
| F-2.1-16 | `budget_for_step` diverges from Section 19.1's per-query-class shape, approved but unreconciled | Step 6.2 |
| Env var name divergence | Section 24 names `PER_USER_DAILY_CAP_USD`; the code uses `PER_USER_DAILY_QUERY_CAP`, since it holds a query count, not dollars | Step 6.2 |
| F-2.2-01 | Generation intermittently emits Cypher with no parentheses around node patterns, the graph rejects it, and nothing retries. Roughly 1 run in 10. Re-homed 2026-08-04: rides with F-2.1-C15 rather than a tool phase, since 3.1 to 3.5 never open `cypher_generation.py` | The `fix/c15-generation-bound` branch, immediately after 3.1 merges |
| F-2.1-J4-02, prompt injection | The guardrail now refuses the injected-instruction shape at admission, verified by 3.0's own premise gate. The `xfail` marker itself is NOT cleared: doing so needs 2.1's gate run five consecutive times against the live graph, and the SSH tunnel cannot be opened from this environment (the Layer-7 proxy cannot tunnel raw SSH, and `block-bash-delete.sh` blocks `ssh` as an execution wrapper). Roughly ten minutes of work whenever the tunnel is reachable | T-3.0-07, environment-gated, not phase-gated |
| F-2.1-C15, generation half | Nothing stops generation producing an unbounded traversal in the first place. Attempted by a builder during 3.0 which inverted its contract, implemented a validator rule with no analysis, and left a rule that rejects `[:orthologous_to {weight: 2*3}]` as unbounded. Reverted; the attempt is preserved as a diff. DATED 2026-08-04 by the product owner rather than left as an open slot, because this is the finding where a generated query took the graph server down for every user | The `fix/c15-generation-bound` branch, immediately after 3.1 merges |
| F-3.0-01 | Section 10.5 requires refusing a write-seeking request and names no `GuardPayload.category` for it. `off_topic` is used and the real explanation lives only in the reason string. Needs either a new enum member (additive, v1-legal) or a spec amendment | Step 6.2 |
| ADV-03, ADV-06, ADV-07 | Three guardrail defense-in-depth gaps where the Guard-tier classifier remains the covering layer: non-Latin-script injection phrases are invisible to the pre-filter's literal phrase list, the write-verb list has gaps, and `classifier.build_messages` does not escape a `</query>` in the payload. Re-homed 2026-08-04 from "the next round", which was never scheduled | 6.1 |
| ADV-02-residual | A non-English question written in pure ASCII with no cognate and no identifier is still refused as off-topic by the pre-filter. Measured: "Welche Krankheiten sind mit dem Gen assoziiert?" A keyword allowlist cannot do language detection, and per-language vocabulary is the infinite-blocklist trap. Mitigated: the classifier now judges off-topic, and the pre-filter abstains on any non-ASCII letter or on a query containing no English function word | 6.1, with the other guardrail hardening |
| F-2.1-07 | Gene symbol resolution beyond a one-entry seed table, needs the Layer 2 NCBI lookup. Also the real fix for build phase 2.2's symbol-versus-CURIE false reject | 3.1 |
| F-2.1-B10 | Same cause as F-2.1-07; an unresolvable symbol errors rather than refuses | 3.1 |
| PubTator3 relations endpoint | Path and fields not yet live-verified | 3.3 |
| F-2.2-06 | A truncated answer discloses the cut but not its scale on a listing query, since `total_available` is None for that shape. Upstream of the Write step | 3.x, whichever phase touches `cypher_query`'s totals |
| F-2.1-A5-05 | `mentioned_in` from BRCA1 costs 27 seconds forward plus the full budget reversed, despite being indexed, anchored, and LIMIT 25. Described, deliberately not reproduced | 3.x |
| F-06 | 2 of 6 model calls per query bypass the stable prompt prefix, a cost inefficiency, not a correctness defect. The Write step's own call is not one of them as of 2.2 | 4.0 |
| F-1.2-01 | The run registry never evicts a completed or abandoned run | 4.0 |
| F-1.2-02 | An abandoned client SSE connection does not halt the server-side task | 4.0 |
| F-1.2-03 | The per-run event queue is single-consumer | 4.0 |
| F-2.0-04 | Nothing writes `interactions` rows, so both daily cost caps read zero | 4.6 |
| F-2.0-10 | `trace_id` is client-supplied and never server-overwritten | 4.6 |
| Golden fixture domain sign-off | Nobody is named to verify the clinical and human-variation expected answers | 5.1 |
| F-1.2-04 | Signup's 409 response undermines login's anti-enumeration guarantee. Pair with F-1.1-10, same defect class in the same endpoint | 6.1 |
| Python lockfile | Every backend dependency floats on `>=`, including security-critical ones | 6.1 |
| Stand up CI | No `.github/workflows/` exists; every gate every phase has passed was run by hand | 6.1 |
| Fix `pip install .` | Fails outright on a `package-dir` mapping error, pre-existing | 6.1 |

Unowned, needing an explicit decision rather than an assumed phase:

- F-1.1-10, F-1.1-11's `User-Agent` half, and F-1.1-18: deferred from build phase 1.1 to 1.2, and 1.2's own ticket list never touched any of the three.
- Auth-path logging: RFC 6819 family revocation still fires silently. Scheduled for build phase 1.2, did not happen, needs a new home.

## Handover

If a different agent takes over, read the "Running this project with a different agent" section in `CLAUDE.md`, which `AGENTS.md` mirrors. Short version: the file artifacts and the model tiering port cleanly, skills and rules port as content but not as invocation, and the four security hooks do not port at all. They are the only structural enforcement in this repo, so substituting them is the first handover step.

One operational note that cost real time on 2026-08-03 and is not obvious from any other file: this machine's network dropped three times in one session, killing two premise-gate runs and three review agents, and every failure they produced looked like a code defect at first glance. Before diagnosing any model-dependent failure, check reachability with `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" --max-time 15 https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models`. An outage shows every premise-gate failure carrying `source='guardrail'`, the first model call in the loop, with an empty narrative and no citations, so nothing reaches synthesis at all. A genuine Write-step defect reaches synthesis and fails later.
